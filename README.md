# Python-Socket-and-HTTP
Understanding and Implementation of Client, Server Model and HTTP requests using python Socker Library.


## Script httpclient.py

The goal of this script is to review the hypertext transfer protocol and gain a better understanding of how it works. It takes a URL and is able to download an arbitrary file named as output.php from the World Wide Web and store it on your hard drive. The program should also print out the complete HTTP header of the response. This is done using Python **Socket** library
